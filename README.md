# Python Mini Apps 
These are the fun projects you need to check it out, in future we will add further more like these.
Currently repository contains a collection of small utility applications developed in Python for learning, practice, and demonstration purposes. Each app explores different Python libraries like `tkinter`, `streamlit`, and standard modules like `calendar` and `qrcode`.

## Fun Apps

### 1. Streamlit Calculator
A simple web-based calculator built using **Streamlit**. It supports basic arithmetic operations and runs in the browser.

-  File: `streamlit_calculator/`

### 2. Tkinter Calculator
A GUI-based calculator made with **Tkinter**, designed to perform basic operations in a desktop window.

-  File: `tkinter_calculator/`

### 3. Calendar Generator
This script takes a year and month as input and displays a formatted calendar using the built-in `calendar` module.

-  File: `calendar_generator/`
-  
### 4. QR Code Generator
Generates a QR code from a given URL or text input and saves it as an image file.

-  File: `qr_code_generator/`

## Purpose

These mini projects were created as part of my learning journey in Python. They demonstrate usage of:
- GUI frameworks
- Python standard libraries
- External libraries for real-world use cases 

## Getting Started

Run Individual Projects using streamlit run __________.py command

Note: You may need to install libraries like streamlit or qrcode manually per project.
